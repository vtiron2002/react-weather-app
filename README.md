Simple weather app using the google and some weather api.

If you want to use this code yourself, you need to get 2 api keys.

1. Google GeoLocation API Key from Google Sevices Console
2. Weather API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/

Once you have the keys, put them in the top of `src/api.js` file.
Like this:

```
const GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "";
const WEATHER_API_KEY = "";
```

Otherwise, if you would like to use my demo site, check out my deployed version.
